# 🎲 Dice Roller - Python Mini Project

This is a simple dice roller project built using Python. It generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, simulating the rolling of a pair of dice.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Roll two dice with random values (1-6)
- Loop continues until user exits
- Input validation for better UX
- Total of both dice is shown

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- `while` loops
- `if-else` conditions
- `random.randint()`
- Taking and validating user input
- Basic logic building in Python

```python
Do you want to roll the dice? (y/n): y
🎲 You rolled: (3, 5)
Total: 8

Do you want to roll the dice? (y/n): n
🙏 Thank you for playing!
